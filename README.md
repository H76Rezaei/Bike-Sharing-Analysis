# Bike-Sharing-Analysis

This project involves analyzing a public bike-sharing dataset from Washington, D.C., provided by the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset). The dataset includes bike rental information from 2011-2012, aggregated with weather data, and was part of a group data science project.

## Objectives
- Explore the dataset to identify key factors influencing bike rental usage.
- Preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and handle anomalies.
- Use machine learning to predict bike usage based on weather conditions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset)
- **Files**: Hourly and daily bike rental data combined with weather information.

## My Contributions
As a group member, I contributed to:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Assisted in cleaning the dataset and handling anomalies to ensure accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Supported the identification of key patterns in rental usage influenced by environmental factors.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
